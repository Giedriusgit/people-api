# Fourth lecture
Bunch of things happened. Overall project restructure, we splitting files into folders even more. Add client, add cors, add post route.

## Overview
In this lecture we created client that fetches data from our server, learned what cors is and added `post` route to add a person to our database. We split our project into following folders:
- `cli` - where our cli and readline code lives
- `client` - where our client code lives
- `database` - where our database code lives
- `server` - where our server code lives
